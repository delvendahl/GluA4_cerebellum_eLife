## Feedforward MF-GC model

Computational model of the MF-GC network. Original model taken from Cayco-Gajic et al. 2017 (doi:10.1038/s41467-017-01109-y). Implemented to run simulations of MF-GC network in Kita et al. 2021 (doi:xxx).  
Simulations are run in Python 2.7 using jNeuroML 0.8.5.  
Dependencies:  
* pyNeuroML (https://github.com/NeuroML/pyNeuroML)
* ??? jLEMS (https://github.com/LEMS/jLEMS)
* jNeuroML (https://github.com/NeuroML/jNeuroML)  
* numpy, matplotlib, scipy
  
Model definitions, network structure and analysis routines are taken from Cayco-Gakic et al. 2017 with slight modifications. Runs 640 input patterns per condition.
