#### __GC_iaf_model__  
This folder contains simulation files to study GC excitability and MF-GC transmission in an integrate-and-fire model. Simulations are implemented in IgorPro software, analysis is run in IgorPro and Python.

#### __MF_GC_network_model__  
This folder contains simulation files of a feedforward MF-GC network model to study population characteristics and learning speed of a perceptron classification task. Simulations are implemented in Python/NeuroML and run using Python and jLEMS.
